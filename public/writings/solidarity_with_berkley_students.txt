Dear Robert Dynes and Robert Birgeneau,

My name is Charlie Harvey, from Oxford in the UK.  

I am writing with regards to your recent involvement in the arrest of a number 
of your own students, which, in my workplace has certainly made your 
institution look somewhat ridiculous! 

I strongly support students' right to make heard their voice in a peaceful 
manner, even if it sometimes interferes with the smooth running of an 
educational institution. 

In this case it is my opinion that the right of young people to engage 
passionately in the struggle for social justice trumps the university's 
right vicariously to exploit workers engaged in the production of official 
garments.

I am sure that in the cold light of day you will reconsider your rather ill 
judged response and instead make sure that you do everything in your power 
to make sure that University approved clothing is not manufactured in an 
unethical manner. 

I furthermore demand your immediate intervention to free those arrested - 
your involvemnet in their arrests hardly strengthens your moral position 
with regards to your institution's involvement in the exploitation of 
poor people!

After all, if people in the UK not only find your actions despicable but 
openly laugh at how mean spirited and silly is your institution's behaviour, 
imagine how must feel your own students!  

Yours,
