Charlie's Java Invaders.
========================

About
-----

This is pretty much uncommented code. Sorry about that - it's a home 
project for fun. I'll try and document it when I get the time.

See http://charlieharvey.org.uk/dppage.pl?id=16 for an 
example of how to deploy as an applet.

To run the application, from the dir above 'invaders', do:
$ java invaders.InvadersApplication

Tested on JVM 1.4.2 && 1.5.
